try 10 kind of standing comedy as your best, and choose 1 of them.

So, I tried online dating recently, and my friends told me to be myself.
I thought, "Great, that's easy."
But then I realized, "Wait a minute, 'myself' is the one that's been single all this time!"
So, I tried being someone else, and now I have a date with a supermodel...
I just hope she's cool with meeting a NASA astronaut who speaks 7 languages and owns a unicorn farm.
